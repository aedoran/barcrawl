      <p>This is a graph debugging tool examine your objects as they are being created. 
      Built with d3, requirejs and socket.io.  I like leaving to let the client render 
      the everything about the view, and the server just pushes the object over a socket.
      On the first push of the object, the client inspects the attributes to determine
      which values are numeric attributes and makes bargraphs for each of them.  After
      that the graph just redraws the when the object is pushed to the client.
      rendering of the graph is done with svg's through d3, which allows for styling the 
      graph through css and attaching mouseevents.</p>
      <p>
      The barcrawl has the following interactions.  Attribute bars above and below the 
      threshold take a different color.  On the mouseover of a bar the the bar takes a color
      and the object info is populated.  The list of objects are all the objects that have 
      each numeric property above the respective threshold. Only the main_property is 
      displayed which is parameter.When clicking on a list item the object info gets displayed 
      as well as the the bars for each its properties get highlighted.
